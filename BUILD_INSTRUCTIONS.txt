## Build the frontend
# 1) Delete everything in the /frontend/dist folder except the .gitignore file (ensures a clean build)

# 2) Go to frontend folder
cd frontend

# 2) Run the build command
npx vue-cli-service build --no-clean

# 2) Go to parent folder
cd ..


## Build the filebrowser binary
# 1) Delete the current 'filebrowser' binary file and 'filebrowser.db' file (if it exists) in the current directory (ensures a clean build)

# 2) Start a WSL environment (I don't know if this can be run in a Windows enironment with a similar structure)
wsl

# 3) run the following command (assume GoLang is installed)
env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build

# 4) exit the WSL environment
exit

## Enable commands in shell terminal
# 1) Start a WSL environment (I don't know if this can be run in a Windows enironment with a similar structure)
wsl

# 2) Run the filebrowser with the --noauth flag to generate a filebrowser.db file with the correct initial configuration (othewise I don't know how to correctly set up --noauth)
./filebrowser -a 0.0.0.0 --noauth -p 8080 -r .

# 3) Kill the running filebrowser program (Ctrl+c). A filebrowser.db file should be in the root folder now.

# 4) Run the update command to the profile to add in all of the commands available
./filebrowser users update admin --commands "echo,cat,cd,cp,ls,mkdir,pwd,tar,touch,unzip,zip"

# 5) exit the WSL environment
exit

## Build the container
docker build --tag filebrowser-ws .
